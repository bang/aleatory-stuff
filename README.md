# aleatory-stuff

Aleatory ideas with no particular project related.

Some stuff that I build to solve my problems. But may be useful for another people.

For now we have this:

* Kickoff-REST-API: Well, I like to have something to start. In this case is a REST service build in Perl/Catalyst
* module-list: Just a Perl script to list installed modules(Perl modules)
* nas-utilities: I have a D-Link 320L NAS solution. One the things that sucks is this product has no Linux support.
                     So I had to create something to automate some things like found the IP where NAS is and mount through NFS
* linux-tricks: Linux tricks that I don't want to forget

That's it!
