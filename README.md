# aleatory-stuff

Aleatory ideas with no particular project related.

Some stuff that I build to solve my problems. But may be useful for another people.

For now we have this:

<ul>

  <li>Kickoff-REST-API: Well, I like to have something to start. In this case is a REST service build in Perl/Catalyst</li>

  <li>module-list: Just a Perl script to list installed modules(Perl modules).</li>
  
  <li>nas-utilities: I have a D-Link 320L NAS solution. One the things that sucks is this product has no Linux support.
                     So I had to create something to automate some things like found the IP where NAS is and mount through NFS.
  </li>
</li>

<br />
That's all!
